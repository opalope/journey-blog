            <p>Tonight is an unusual snowy night in the Pacific Northwest, and I'm here, learning, and practicing the foundations and essentials to software development, primarily web development.</p>

            <p>I officially started my endeavor in late August, 2021, learning the basics of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> through <strong><a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a></strong>. With the worries of a fully independent twenty-year-old, I had shifted my focus towards aspects of my life that needed my attention. The code would have to hold off for a while.</p>

            <p>Over the course of a couple months, as my patience with working dead-end jobs was growing thin, I started seriously debating what I wanted to do as a career. I thought back to August, and started researching my options of becoming a software developer. I started back up in November, 2021. I have been using <strong><a href="https:/theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a></strong> as a curriculum to teach myself the foundations to create efficient, functional, and aesthetically pleasing websites.</p>

            <p>I still have a <em>lot</em> to learn, but that's why I am creating this blog; to document the beginning of what Iâ€™m hoping to be a long, fruitful journey.</p>

            <p class="entry-date"><u>January 2, 2022</u></p>

            <p>Happy New Year! I'm two days into the new year and I have set some pretty exciting goals for myself! My biggest goal that I will achieve is to land a Junior Software Developing position. I would love for 2022 to be the year I start my career. With everything going on in the past two years, such as Covid-19, political division, exorbitant rental prices, etc., the start of my twenties has been nothing but uncertain.</p>

            <p>Since my last entry, I have learned more about <strong>CSS</strong>, such as the <em>Box Model</em>, <em>Block and Inline</em>, <em>Flexbox</em> and its properties (growing/shrinking, main axis/cross axis, alignment). These concepts have been relatively easy to learn, but applying is a little more complicated. I'm enjoying the process of it all.</p>

            <p>In the Odin Project, I have been doing various exercises they have created in Visual Studio Code. What I enjoy the most is they don't walk you through it, I have to figure it out. There have been moments where the code wasn't doing what I wanted it to :P, so I would step away for a couple minutes, let my brain deflate, then come back. Majority of the time, the solution pops up in my head. My next assignment will be to create a more professional looking website, so I'm excited. I'll write about how it goes :).</p>
