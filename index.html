    <h5>December 27th, 2021</h5>

<p>Tonight is an unusual snowy night in the Pacific Northwest, and I'm here, learning, and practicing the foundations and essentials to software development, primarily web development.</p>

<p>I officially started my endeavor in late August, 2021, learning the basics of HTML and CSS through <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a>. With the worries of a fully independent twenty-year-old, I had shifted my focus towards aspects of my life that needed my attention. The code would have to hold off for a while.</p>

<p>Over the course of a couple months, as my patience with working dead-end jobs was growing thin, I started seriously debating what I wanted to do as a career. I thought back to August, and started researching my options of becoming a software developer. I started back up in November, 2021. I have been using <a href="https:/theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> as a curriculum to teach myself the foundations to create efficient, functional, and aesthetically pleasing websites.</p>

<p>I still have a <em>lot</em> to learn, but that’s why I am creating this blog; to document the beginning of what I’m hoping to be a long, fruitful journey.</p>
